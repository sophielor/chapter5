			<h2>HTML: Text Formatting</h2>
				<h3><br>
<strong>HTML</strong> <br> provides in-text formatting tags to apply specific text-related styles to portions of text, in addition to creating elements. This topic includes examples of text formatting in HTML, such as highlighting, bolding, underlining, subscript, and strikethrough text. <br><br>

<strong>Highlighting</strong>
- The < mark > element is a new addition to HTML5 and is used to highlight or mark text in a document that is relevant in another context, such as search results. It's commonly used to highlight searched query terms in search results to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for. The < mark > element is placed around the text that needs to be highlighted, as demonstrated in the example provided.<br><br>

<strong>Bold</strong>
- To bold text, use the < strong > or < b > tags

The difference is, <strong>SEMANTICS</strong>
- The < strong > tag is used to convey the fundamental or semantic importance of text to the surrounding context, while < b > tag is used simply to bold text without indicating any importance. <br><br>

<strong>Italic</strong>
- To italicize text, use the < em > or < i > tags

The difference here was also <bold>SEMANTICS</bold>
- The < em > tag is used to add emphasis or stress to the text, while the < i > tag is used to set off text from the normal text around it without adding emphasis. <br><br>

<strong>Underline</strong>
- The < u > element was deprecated in HTML 4 but has been reintroduced with alternate semantic meaning in HTML 5. It is used to represent an unarticulated, non-textual annotation, such as misspelled text or a Chinese proper name mark. 
< p >This paragraph contains some <u>mispelled</u>
text.< /p ><br><br>

<strong>Abbreviation</strong>
- To mark some expression as an abbreviation, use
< abbr > tag<br><br>

<strong>Inserted</strong>
- To mark text as inserted, use the < ins > tag:
< ins >New Text< /ins >. <br><br>

<strong>Deleted</strong>
- To mark text as deleted, use the < del > tag:
< del >Deleted Text< /del >.<br><br>

<strong>Stricken</strong>
- To strike through text, use the < s > tag:
< s >Struck-through text here< /s >. <br><br>

<strong>Superscript</strong>
- To create superscript:
< sup >superscript here< /sup >.<br><br>

<strong>Subscript</strong>
- To create subscript:
< sub >subscript here< /sub >. <br><br>
